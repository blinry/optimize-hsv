Description
-----------

Simple demo application for the optimizer. Takes an image as first parameter, then displays a HSV-variation in firefox, asks for a score, and tries to optimize. Repeat.

To build, issue `make`. The optimizer has to live parellel to this directory.

If you don't want to press <F5> all the time, install a plugin like *Auto Reload*.

Sample invocation
-----------------

   ./bin/optimize-hsv path/to/lena.png
